                "PISCES (Pelagic Interaction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies) (Aumont and Bopp, 2006) simulates the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and of the major nutrients determining phytoplankton growth (phosphate, nitrate, ammonium, iron and silicic acid). The carbon chemistry of the model is based on the Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP2) protocol (Najjar et al, 2007) and the parametrization proposed by Wanninkhof (1992) is used to compute air-sea gas exchange of CO2 and O2. PISCES includes a simple representation of the marine ecosystem with two phytoplankton size classes, representing nanophytoplankton and diatoms, as well as two zooplankton size classes, representing microzooplankton and mesozooplankton. Phytoplankton growth is limited by the availability of nutrients, temperature, and light. There are three non-living components of organic carbon in the model: semi-labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with a lifetime of several weeks to years, as well as large and small detrital particles, which are fuelled by mortality, aggregation, fecal pellet production and grazing. Biogenic silica and calcite particles are also included.\r\n\r\nNutrients and/or carbon are supplied to the ocean from three different sources: atmospheric deposition, rivers and sediment mobilization. These sources are explicitly included but do not vary in time apart from a climatological seasonal cycle for the atmospheric input. Atmospheric deposition (Fe, N, P and Si) has been estimated from the INCA model (Aumont et al, 2008). River discharge of carbon and nutrients is taken from Ludwig et al (1996). Iron input from sediment mobilization has been parameterized as in Aumont and Bopp (2006). \r\n\r\nPISCES is used here not only to compute air-sea fluxes of carbon, but also to compute the effect of a biophysical coupling: the chlorophyll concentration produced by the biological component retroacts on the ocean heat budget by modulating the absorption of light as well as the oceanic heating rate (see Lengaigne et al (2007) for a detailed description)."
