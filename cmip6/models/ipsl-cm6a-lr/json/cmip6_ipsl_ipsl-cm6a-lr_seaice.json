                "LIM2 (Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model, Version 2) is a two-level thermodynamic-dynamic sea ice model (Fichefet and Morales Maqueda, 1997, 1999). Sensible heat storage and vertical heat conduction within snow and ice are determined by a three-layer model. The storage of latent heat inside the ice resulting from the trapping of shortwave radiation by brine pockets is taken into account. The surface albedo is parametrized as a function of the surface temperature and the snow and ice thicknesses. Vertical and lateral growth/decay rates of the ice are obtained from prognostic energy budgets at both the bottom and surface boundaries of the snow-ice cover and in leads. For the momentum balance, sea ice is considered as a two-dimensional continuum in dynamical interaction with atmosphere and ocean. The viscous-plastic constitutive law proposed by Hibler (1979) is used for computing the internal ice force. The ice strength is taken as a function of the ice thickness and compactness. The physical fields that are advected are the ice concentration, the snow and ice volume and enthalpy, and the brine reservoir. The sea ice and ocean models have the same horizontal grid."
