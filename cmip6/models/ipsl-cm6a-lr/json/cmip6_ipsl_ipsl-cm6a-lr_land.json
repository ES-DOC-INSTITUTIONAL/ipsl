                "ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms) is a land-surface model that simulates the energy and water cycles of soil and vegetation, the terrestrial carbon cycle, and the vegetation composition and distribution (Krinner et al, 2005). The land surface is described as a mosaic of twelve plant functional types (PFTs) and bare soil. The definition of PFT is based on ecological parameters such as plant physiognomy (tree or grass), leaves (needle-leaf or broad-leaf), phenology (evergreen, summergreen or raingreen) and photosynthesis pathways for crops and grasses (C3 or C4). Relevant biophysical and biogeochemical parameters are prescribed for each PFT.\r\n\r\nExchanges of energy (latent, sensible, and kinetic energy) and water, between the atmosphere and the biosphere are based on the work of Ducoudr\u00e9 et al (1993); de Rosnay and Polcher (1998) and calculated at a 30min time step together with the exchange of carbon during photosynthesis. The soil water budget within the standard version of ORCHIDEE is done with a 2-layers bucket model (de Rosnay and Polcher, 1998). The water that is not infiltrated or drained at the bottom of the soil is transported through rivers and aquifers (d\u2019Orgeval et al, 2008). This routing scheme allows re-evaporation of the water on its way to the ocean through floodplains or irrigation (de Rosnay et al, 2003).\r\n\r\nThe exchanges of water and energy at the land surface are interlinked with the exchange of carbon. The vegetation state (ie foliage density, interception capacity, soil-water stresses) is computed dynamically within ORCHIDEE (Krinner et al, 2005) and accounts for carbon assimilation, carbon allocation and senescence processes. Carbon exchange at the leaf level during photosynthesis is based on Farquhar et al (1980) and Collatz et al (1992) for C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways, respectively. Concomitant water exchange through transpiration is linked to photosynthesis via the stomatal conductance, following the formulation of Ball et al (1987). Photosynthesis is calculated at a 30min time step while carbon allocation in the different soil-plant reservoirs is performed at a daily time step."
